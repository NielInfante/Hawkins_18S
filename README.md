# WV_16S
Templates for 16S analysis


These are a series of R scripts to help with 16S analysis using Dada2. These are not ready to run, you'll have to make changes to directories and condition names.

## Order

First, set up your directories. There should be sub directories called Data, filtered, and pics. In Data there should be the trained taxonomic data.

### Start with doDada.R

### Do Filtering with doPhyloseq.R

### Do differential abundance with doDeseq.R

### Do Beta diversity with doVeganBeta.R

### Do Alpha analysis with doAlpha.R

### Make pretty pictures with drawPics.R
